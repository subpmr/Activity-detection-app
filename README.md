# Description
The most widely used inertial sensors are accelerometers and gyroscopes. An accelerometer
consists of a mass suspended by a spring and placed in a housing. The mass inside the
accelerometer moves depending on the acceleration of the sensor and displacement of the
mass is measured as the difference of acceleration. A gyroscope sensor measures the angular
velocity by using the tendency of vibration in the same plane as an object vibrates.
Magnetometer used to find out the direction of movement of the person. Moreover, Inertial
sensor systems provide an ideal setting for activity recognition.
Write an 9-Axis Sensor Fusion algorithm to recognise real-time activity. You must be able to
differentiate between following activity
1. Walking
2. Running
3. Sitting
4. Standing
5. Cycling
6. Lying

Show these activity in a TextView in your mobile screen.
